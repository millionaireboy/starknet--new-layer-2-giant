# starknet--new-layer-2-giant
Layer-2 is considered the key to effectively solving the problem of transaction speed on Ethereum. Currently, Layer-2 projects are still quite new but are attracting great attention from the community, notably the Starknet project.
What is Starknet?
Starknet is a layer 2 solution (Layer 2) on the Ethereum network using ZK-Rollups technology, allowing dApp developers to be unlimited in scale of operation while still ensuring comprehensive security from Ethereum.

The Starknet operating system and contract are written in Cairo – a programming language that supports the development and scaling of dApps that are not limited by any service logic.

Outstanding features of Starknet
Cairo language installer
This is a language that allows programmers to scale and develop dApps or smart contracts in any field. All protocols or dApps built on Starknet will use Cairo.

Ability of extension
This is one of the most outstanding and superior features of Starknet when it comes to expansion support. It maintains the security of Ethereum Layer 1 by generating STARK certificates off-chain (off-chain) and then defining the proofs on-chain (on-chain).

Support developers
Developers can develop business models using Starknet contracts (Starknet Contracts). Through this, developers can carry out their projects profitably.

Merge abilities
Starknet provides aggregation capabilities, enabling projects on the Ethereum network to interact and connect with each other easily.

Zk-Rollups technology
The Zero-know Rollups solution (also known as ZK-Rollups) is capable of “Rollups” hundreds of off-chain transactions on Layer 2 and generates cryptographically authenticated SNARKs. This is considered valid proof and is stored on the Ethereum network. ZK-Rollups do not require supervision once the block is verified, the user's assets are always guaranteed to be recoverable immediately upon valid rejection by the operators. This technology will help make the connection between Layer 1 and Layer 2 easy and convenient, especially the interaction time between projects becomes quick.
